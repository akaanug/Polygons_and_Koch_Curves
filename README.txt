You can run assignment1.html file in your browser without any preliminary.

To save the canvas, you may click the save canvas button and the JSON file will
be automatically installed to your default downloads folder.

You can load the downloaded JSON files by choosing them from the input field and
then clicking load file button.

Color of the current vertex changes automatically when you change the values
through the RGB slider. You may press "f" to fill the polygon only if it is
formed with the currently drawn lines.

Also, the "out" folder contains the documentation of the assignment1.js file. You can reach these documentations by clicking the link under the canvas. I generated the output file by using JSDoc package.
